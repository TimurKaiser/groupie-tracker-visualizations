**Groupie Trackers**

Groupie Trackers is a project aimed at building a user-friendly website that displays information about bands and artists, their concert locations and dates, and the relationships between them. The project emphasizes data visualization and interaction, focusing on creating events/actions that trigger communication between the client and the server.

### Project Overview

- **Backend**: The backend of the website is written in Go, utilizing only standard Go packages.
  
- **Frontend**: The frontend is built using HTML and CSS, providing a user-friendly interface for viewing band information and data visualizations.
  
- **Data**: The project utilizes a provided API containing information about bands, concert locations, dates, and relationships between them. This data is manipulated and displayed on the website.

### Features

1. **Data Visualization**: The website displays band information through various data visualizations such as blocks, cards, tables, lists, pages, and graphics.

2. **Event/Action Handling**: Events/actions triggered by the client, time, or other factors are handled by the server. These actions may include client calls to the server to retrieve information using the request-response model.

### Instructions

1. **Backend in Go**: The backend must be written in Go, utilizing standard Go packages only.

2. **Stability**: The site and server should not crash at any time. All pages must work correctly, handling any errors gracefully.

3. **Best Practices**: The code must adhere to good practices, including proper documentation, naming conventions, and code organization.

4. **Testing**: It is recommended to have test files for unit testing to ensure the stability and reliability of the application.

### How to Use

1. **Installation**: Clone the repository to your local machine.

2. **Setup**: Ensure you have Go installed on your system. Run `go run .` to start the server.

3. **Access**: Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3001` to access the Groupie Trackers website.

4. **Interact**: Explore the website to view band information and data visualizations. Trigger events/actions to communicate with the server and retrieve information as needed.
